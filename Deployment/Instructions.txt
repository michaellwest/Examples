Requirements:
1. Visual Studio 2012 installed on your local machine.
2. IIS installed on destination server.

Setup:
1. Copy Demo project to C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\ on your local machine.
2. Open the BuildDeploy.bat and change the server parameter.
3. Enable-PSRemoting on the destination server (ensure all your network connections are not Public).

Usage:
Open the deployment directory and run the BuildDeploy.bat

What Happens?
1. BuildDeploy.bat will run the BuildDeploy.ps1.
2. BuildDeploy.ps1 will run the msbuild.exe which builds the Application.msbuild.
3. Application.msbuild is a generic file that will compile Demo.csproj.
4. PublishApplication.ps1 is loaded into the session then Publish-Application is called.
5. The code is copied to the \\web01\c$\Builds (this is to avoid the multi-hop issue in remoting)
6. Install-WebApplication is executed remotely on web01 and then IIS is configured to host the new application. The code is copied to C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\ on web01.

I hope this works right out of the box for you.

Troubleshooting:
1. Configuration change when not in a domain
  a. winrm set winrm/config/client @{TrustedHosts="<ServerName>"}
